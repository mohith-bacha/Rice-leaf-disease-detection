# Rice leaf disease detection
  Detecting rice leaf diseases using Python involves collecting a labeled dataset of rice leaf images, which includes both healthy leaves and those affected by various diseases. The images are preprocessed through resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance the dataset's diversity. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is then employed for its proficiency in handling image classification tasks. This model is trained on the preprocessed dataset to learn the features distinguishing healthy leaves from diseased ones. Once trained, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Finally, the trained model can be deployed to detect diseases in new rice leaf images, providing a valuable tool for farmers to identify and manage crop diseases efficiently.
